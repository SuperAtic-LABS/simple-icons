# Vector Icons

![Vector Icons Preview](vectoricons.png)

A free set of SVG icons in Scalable Vector Graphic files with an accompanying list of corporate colour codes. See the icons and colours at [our website](http://vectoricons.design).

## Feedback and Requests

I want to grow this set, so if you have a specific request—or a comment—create an <a href="https://github.com/danleech/simple-icons/issues">Issue</a> on this repository. Icons will be added over time, and existing ones may be updated. Alternatively you can tweet me [@superatic](https://twitter.com/super_atic).

### Webfont versions

This is definitely something I’d like to include, but it’ll require me to take some time off work to complete. Hopefully that will happen sometime this summer. ![Vector Icons Preview](http://fontastic.me) 

P.S. If you have experience with best-practice optimisation and minification of SVG files please get in touch. I could do with honing my SVG workflow before embarking on a full refresh of this set.
